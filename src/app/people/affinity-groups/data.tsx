  "Affinity groups at McMurtry, as extensions of the Diversity Council, aim to foster a sense of community among certain student populations including LGBTQ+, Black, Latinx, Jewish, and First-Gen/Low Income. These groups will be hosting movie nights, game nights, and other events throughout the semester in order to support and encourage connections in these groups. If you identify with one or more of these groups, we highly encourage you to join the group chats, meet new Murts and participate in any upcoming events!",
  "Each affinity group has a designated liaison who acts as a bridge between the group and the Diversity Council. These are some really cool Murts who will be hosting events and activities for you all to enjoy. If you have any questions about a specific group, please feel free to reach out to the associated liaison or any member in the Diversity Council.",
  "If you are interested in joining one of the affinity groups, please reach out to the affinity group heads listed below!",
