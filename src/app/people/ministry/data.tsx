const description = [
  "At Rice, all 11 colleges have an internal, student-run government designed to deal with various aspects of the college. At McMurtry, our student government is known as the McMinistry. The McMinistry contains the Executive Council (EC), which includes the President, Chief Justice(s), Internal and External VPs, Prime Minister, At-Large Representative, Secretaries, Treasurers, Parliamentarian, and SA Senator.",
  "The EC conducts various functions, including overseeing the committee system, advocating for ideas and initiatives, creating and managing the budget, and much more. In addition to the EC, the At-Large Rep serves as the head of the Peopleâ€™s Council (PC) and represents the interests of McMurtry College as a whole.",
  "The PC includes 9 Hall Reps, 9 Class Reps, and the Diversity and Culturals committee heads. The Class Reps include three First Year Reps who are elected in the fall (and you can be one!). Many of the events that are planned for McMurtry students are organized through the various committees. The McMinistry meets bi-weekly for Town Hall, which are meetings to discuss current Murt news, hold voting sessions, and are an open forum for any Murt to voice their opinion (free snacks too!).",
